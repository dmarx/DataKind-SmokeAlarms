# DataKind project for the Red Cross: targetting distribution of free smoke alarms

This repository contains code for a datakind project helping the Red Cross 
determine where to focus their smoke alarm distribution efforts. My (David Marx) 
contribution (this repository) is attempting to model the probability of human 
injury/death in a fire. Other team members are modeling fire risk and smoke 
detector prevalence. Models will be combined to form a joint risk incorporating 
the probability of a fire, the risk of injury/death given a fire, and the 
probability of needing a smoke detector to identify areas that could benefit the 
most from the Red Cross' initiative. The plan is to give recommendations at the 
census tract level, model and data permitting.
